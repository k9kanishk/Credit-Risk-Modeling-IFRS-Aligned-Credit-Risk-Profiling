# Credit Risk Modeling: IFRS-Aligned Credit Risk Profiling

## Overview

This project revolves around building a predictive model to assess credit risk, rooted in the context of modern financial regulations, particularly the IFRS 9 standard. Utilizing a dataset of historical loan applications, the model aims to predict potential defaulters, aiding financial institutions in making informed lending decisions.

## Key Features

- **Data Exploration & Cleaning**: Comprehensive EDA to understand the dataset's structure, distribution, and potential patterns. Addressed missing or anomalous data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Derived new features and transformed existing ones to enhance the model's predictive capability.
- **Modeling with XGBoost**: Deployed the XGBoost algorithm, known for its efficiency and effectiveness in handling imbalanced datasets.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimized model parameters to achieve a balance between precision and recall.
- **Business Impact Analysis**: Highlighted the potential financial implications of the model's predictions, emphasizing the balance between opportunity costs and direct financial losses.

## Potential IFRS 9 Alignment

While the model focuses on predicting defaults (related to Probability of Default or PD), for full IFRS 9 compliance, it needs to incorporate calculations around Loss Given Default (LGD) and Exposure at Default (EAD), along with classifying loans into IFRS 9 specified stages.
